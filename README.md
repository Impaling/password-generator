# password-generator
**An open-source random password generator written in Java, by me.**

A **download** can be found at https://github.com/Impaling/password-generator/releases.

This generator uses JavaFX and JFoenix libraries. 

JFoenix can be found here: https://github.com/jfoenixadmin/JFoenix.

Note: The class "passwordGenerator" should be capitalized, sorry for the awkward naming convention there.
